# ASCII-Art-Generator Pénélope 

## In this project, you have access to a python code that converts everything you write into ASCII art. 
To do so, all you have to do is to run the ASCII-art-generator.py file and write what you want in the terminal.
This app uses the pyfiglet library to properly function, so make sure you download it!
You can contribute to this project by helping optimizing this code.
